[Metadata 101](https://www.github.com/metadata101) is a **public** repository where metadata schemas are stored as simple sets of files that can be reused by metadata application developers. These schemas make it easier to support community‑specific metadata standards, profiles, and validation rules in catalogue and data management tools. 

Currently actively maintained profiles are:

* [iso19139.nl.services.1.2.1](https://github.com/metadata101/iso19139.nl.services.1.2.1)
* [iso19139.nl.services.2.0.0](https://github.com/metadata101/iso19139.nl.services.2.0.0)

## Project goals

- Provide a shared, versioned home for XML metadata schemas and community profiles. 
- Enable software developers to plug these schemas into their own applications with minimal effort.
- Document how schemas are structured so that new communities can publish their own profiles consistently

## What is a metadata schema?

In Metadata101, an XML [metadata schema]({% link metadata-and-profiles.md %}) describes how a metadata record is structured and validated for a particular standard or community.
